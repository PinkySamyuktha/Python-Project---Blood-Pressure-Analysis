# Blood Pressure Analysis (Python Project)

## Overview
Developed a Python-based data analysis pipeline to investigate how lifestyle factors influence blood pressure readings. This project demonstrates the use of regression, visualization, and basic statistical analysis on health datasets.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Statistical Visualization
- Correlation & Regression Analysis
- Healthcare Insight Generation

## Project Steps
1. Loaded and cleaned dataset containing lifestyle and BP variables.
2. Visualized relationships between sleep, diet, physical activity, and BP.
3. Performed correlation and linear regression to find statistically significant predictors.
4. Interpreted results and generated plots for clinical decision-making support.

## Outcome
Identified key factors contributing to high/low blood pressure. Helped simulate preventive strategies that could guide public health policy and personal lifestyle changes.
